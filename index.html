Themes of public health and equity inspire my innovations in computer science. These themes have led to my focus on:
<br><br>
1) The design and implementation of data mining and machine learning methods for addressing challenges related to data and goals of public health and equity, including:
<ul>
<li>Understanding the data generating process for human-sourced data, in order to better understand causal mechanisms and design causal discovery methods (JPH 2020, IJERPH 2020).</li> 

<li>Generating useful features from satellite imagery, social media and other data by coupling machine learning methods and spatio-temporal statistics (CSCW 2017, CSCW 2018a, CSCW 2018b, CVPR CV4GC 2019).</li> 

<li>Developing machine learning methods that account for social and environmental factors ("social determinants") and elevating ideas of algorithmic fairness to include structural advantages (medRxiv2020, arXiv2020).</li>
</ul>
<br>
2) My fundamental and applied research into design of algorithmic systems within the context of social systems in particular in relation to fairness and ethics, including:  
<ul>
<li>Addressing challenges of identifying who the data represents and maintaining fairness even with data shift (AJPM 2016, ICWSM 2018, NeurIPS FairML 2019).</li> 

<li>
Given the realistic challenges of data collected in different environments, development of new methods for domain adaptation that use local information as necessary, can account for differences in the population in each environment and ensure fairness even with population Differences (NeurIPS ML4H 2018, CHIL 2020, FAccT21).</li> 

<li>Leveraging domain information as priors to improve prediction (Sigspatial 2018, CHIL2020)</li>
</ul>
<br>
My focus on public health, which is concerned with the individual, collective, environmental and organizational factors, in and out of the hospital, that affect the health of human populations, naturally bridges my work with fields such as economics, policy, sociology and healthcare. 
Accordingly, I have sourced and work many forms of information including social media, mobile phone, satellite imagery, electronic health record, telemedicine, and claims data, and in sum, my lab makes transformative scholarly contribution to computer science inspired a range of technical questions inspired by the opportunity of new data sources and problems in public health.

*Updates*<br>
I am teaching a short course on Data Science and Machine Learning for Public Health Research and Practice at NYU in August 2020.
<br>
I designed a Machine Learning for Public Health course which will be taught for the first time in Spring 2021 at NYU.
<br>
I am running an international, monthly Machine Learning in Public Health reading group. Please get in touch with me if you're interested.
